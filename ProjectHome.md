This project provides demonstration applications based on toot2 and tootaudioservers. Effectively it is a test suite.

It also contains very immature code not ready for toot2.

The toot2 project provides core models and frameworks for java audio and midi applications.

The tootaudioservers project provides implementations of the toot2 AudioServer interface and supporting classes.
